# The Opioid Epidemic
## About
For this project I worked with my Data Science classmates to analyze the opioid epidemic from 2014-2018 and specifically look into how prescription rates for opioids affect overdose rates in the US. Click [here](https://cmurphy28.github.io/opioid-epidemic.github.io/) to access the webpage. Our code contains the following data analysis:
### U.S. Maps of Precription Rates and Overdose Rates
Here we show filling maps for both prescription rates and overdose rates in the United Sates. The darker colored states have higher prescription and overdose rates. 
### Pearson's Correlation Test
Here we analyzed the correlation between prescription and overdose rates and looked into how precriptions could be affecting overdoses in the US. 
### K-means Clustering
We used K-means clustering in order to group together the States that have been most affected by the Opioid epidemic. We have a different clustering for each year 2014-2018 and we determine the most affected states depending on their prescription and overdose rates.
