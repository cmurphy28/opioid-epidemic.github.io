# The Opioid Epidemic
## About
For this project I worked with a couple of my friends in analyzing the opioid epidemic from 2014-2018 and specifically looking into how prescription rates for opioids affected overdose rates in the US. Click [here](https://cmurphy28.github.io/opioid-epidemic.github.io/) to access the webpage. Our code conatins the following data analysis:
### U.S. Maps of Precription Rates and Overdose Rates
Here we show filling maps for both prescription rates and overdose rates in the United Sates. The darker colored states have higher prescription and overdose rates. 
### Pearson's Correlation Test
Here we analyzed the correlation between prescription rates and overdose rates and looked into how the presctiption rate affects the overdose rate in the US. 
### K-means Clustering
We used K-means clustering in order to group together the States that have been most affected by the Opioid epidemic. We have a different clustering for each year 2014-2018 and we determine the most affected states depending on their prescription and overdose rates.
